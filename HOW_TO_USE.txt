Welcome to PYMusic, the easy Python Music Player.

To get started, insert your audio files into the MUSIC folder.

Then click on main.exe to launch the application.

Nothing will show up at the screen at first. To play a song, click on the play icon.

You can use the Forward and Backward icons to change between songs inside the folder. 

You can use the Up and Down icons on the right side of the program to change the volume.

Lastly, you can use the pause icon to pause the song.

Click the icon once to pause the song, then once again to unpause.

Removing any files while the application is running will cause the program to crash.

Thank you and enjoy PYMusic.
